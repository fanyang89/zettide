# libelection

`libelection` is a C SDK for durable, fixed-membership leader election. It uses
raftz for consensus, an internal grpc-lite transport, and a WAL for restart
recovery.

## Build

Zig 0.16.0 and a Linux C/C++ toolchain are required. ReleaseSafe is the default
optimization mode.

```sh
zig build test --summary all
zig build test-installed-c-sdk --summary all
zig build install-c-sdk --prefix /path/to/prefix
```

The SDK installs these files:

```text
include/libelection/libelection.h
lib/libelection.a
lib/libelection.so
lib/libelection.so.1
lib/libelection.so.1.0.0
```

Link a C program against the shared library:

```sh
cc app.c -I/path/to/prefix/include -L/path/to/prefix/lib \
  -lelection -pthread -ldl -lrt -lm -o app
```

The static library includes its Zig, grpc-lite, nghttp2, and c-ares objects.
It also needs the C++ runtime used by crc32c:

```sh
cc app.c -I/path/to/prefix/include /path/to/prefix/lib/libelection.a \
  -pthread -ldl -lrt -lm -lstdc++ -o app
```

## Configuration

Every node receives the same ordered-independent peer set and cluster ID. Each
node ID must be nonzero and unique. Peer addresses use `host:port` syntax, and
multi-node peer ports must be nonzero. The local peer address is advertised to
other nodes and may differ from `listen_address`, such as when listening on a
wildcard interface.

Each node needs a dedicated persistent `data_dir`. The SDK creates missing path
components, binds the directory to its node and cluster IDs, and holds an
exclusive process lock until destroy. Do not reuse a data directory with another
node ID, cluster ID, or membership list.

Initialize public structs with their macros so `struct_size` and defaults are
set correctly:

```c
election_node_options options = ELECTION_NODE_OPTIONS_INIT;
election_callbacks callbacks = ELECTION_CALLBACKS_INIT;
election_status status = ELECTION_STATUS_INIT;
```

`election_node_create` copies all option strings and peers. The caller may free
that input after the function returns.

## Drive Modes

Managed mode is the default. `election_node_start` creates a driver thread that
runs the Raft loop, advances logical ticks at `tick_interval_ms`, and invokes
callbacks.

External mode lets the host drive Raft from one thread:

```c
options.drive_mode = ELECTION_DRIVE_EXTERNAL;
election_node_start(node);

for (;;) {
  election_node_poll(node, NULL);
  election_node_tick(node, NULL);
}
```

`election_node_poll` processes pending Raft and transport work without advancing
logical time. Each `election_node_tick` advances exactly one logical tick. The
SDK still owns the grpc-lite network runtime in external mode. Calling `poll`
or `tick` on a managed node returns `ELECTION_ERROR_INVALID_STATE`.

Serialize lifecycle functions with all other calls for the same node. Call
`election_node_destroy` only after every other call has returned, and never use
the handle afterward. External `poll` and `tick` calls must run on one host
thread.

## Callbacks

`ELECTION_EVENT_LEADERSHIP_ACQUIRED` is emitted only after a leader commits an
entry in its current term. `ELECTION_EVENT_LEADERSHIP_LOST` follows loss of
active leadership, including a clean shutdown. `ELECTION_EVENT_FAILED` reports
a terminal driver failure.

Managed callbacks run on the SDK driver thread. External callbacks run
synchronously inside `poll`, `tick`, or `shutdown`. Callback data is borrowed
until the callback returns. A callback may call `election_node_get_status`, but
must not call lifecycle or drive functions for the originating node. No callback
runs after `election_node_shutdown` returns.

## Example

Build the managed-mode C node:

```sh
zig build example
```

Start three terminals with the same cluster ID and peer list:

```sh
zig-out/bin/election-node 1 00112233445566778899aabbccddeeff \
  127.0.0.1:7101 data/node-1 \
  1=127.0.0.1:7101 2=127.0.0.1:7102 3=127.0.0.1:7103
```

Use node IDs 2 and 3 with their matching listen addresses and data directories
for the other processes. Send `SIGINT` or `SIGTERM` for a clean shutdown.

See `include/libelection/libelection.h` for the complete ABI.

## Fenced VIP Demo

The Linux demo combines `libelection` with
[`vip-manager` v5.0.0](https://github.com/cybertec-postgresql/vip-manager/releases/tag/v5.0.0).
`libelection` chooses the owner, a host-side fencer isolates the previous
owner's service interface, and vip-manager configures the IPv4 address and
sends a gratuitous ARP reply.

The Raft and service networks are separate. A new leader remains unavailable
until the fencer has disabled the previous owner's service-side veth, persisted
the new term and owner, and returned a grant. The local `/leader` endpoint then
returns HTTP 200, which causes vip-manager to add the VIP. Leadership loss,
driver starvation, a terminal error, or an unavailable fencer keeps the endpoint
at HTTP 503.

Run the unprivileged bridge and protocol smoke test:

```sh
zig build test-vip-bridge --summary all
```

Run the three-node network namespace demo on a Linux host with `ip`, `curl`,
`tar`, and passwordless or pre-authorized sudo:

```sh
sudo -v
mise run demo-vip
```

The task downloads the official vip-manager release for x86-64 or AArch64 and
verifies its pinned SHA-256 checksum. The demo then creates three node
namespaces, a client namespace, independent Raft and service bridges, and a
host-side fencer. It verifies initial acquisition, isolates the leader's Raft
link, checks that its service link is fenced, waits for failover, pings the VIP,
and confirms that the client neighbor entry moved to the new owner's MAC.

The bridge also exposes `/healthz` and `/status` on its configured loopback HTTP
listener. `/status` reports local Raft and fencing state for diagnostics; only
`/leader` is used by vip-manager.

See [`demo/README.md`](demo/README.md) for the process interfaces, fencing state
rules, and production security boundary.
