//! Raft Figure 8 safety test: leader only commits entries from its own term.
//!
//! This is the formal proof that a Raft leader never commits entries from
//! previous terms indirectly (by committing a newer entry). The test follows
//! the scenario from the Raft paper, Figure 8:
//!
//!   (a) Leader S1 replicates entry at term 2 to S2 only, then crashes.
//!   (b) S5 wins election at term 3 with votes from S3, S4, S5.
//!   (c) S5 crashes after appending its term-3 entry; S1 restarts, wins
//!       election at term 4, and begins replicating.
//!   (d) If S1 replicates its term-4 entry to a majority BEFORE the term-2
//!       entry on S2 is overwritten, then the term-2 entry is committed.
//!       But if a majority has NOT replicated the term-4 entry, the term-2
//!       entry is NOT committed — even if S1 crashes again.
//!
//! Key assertion: "leader only commits log from current term".
