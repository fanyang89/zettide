# Upstream Test Suites

This directory tracks behavioral tests and invariants derived from established
Raft implementations. CI uses only the committed Zig tests and manifests; it
does not fetch upstream repositories.

Each inventory entry has one status:

- `adapted`: implemented from a permissively licensed upstream test.
- `reimplemented`: independently implemented from observable behavior.
- `covered_elsewhere`: an existing raftz test already covers the behavior.
- `excluded`: outside scope, implementation-specific, or delegated to the primary baseline by source policy.
- `blocked`: relevant, but the product or test harness lacks a prerequisite.
- `planned`: accepted for future implementation.

etcd/raft is the primary behavioral baseline. raft-rs contributes only
meaningful deltas and historical regressions. OpenRaft contributes stateful
invariants. HashiCorp Raft behavior is reimplemented clean-room because its
source is MPL-2.0; no HashiCorp test code is copied. Dragonboat contributes
only core deltas and historical regressions; its etcd-derived tests remain
delegated to the primary baseline. NodeHost and multi-group behavior,
witnesses, quiesce, rate limiting, delayed snapshot acknowledgements, log
queries, and implementation-specific Update or LogDB contracts are excluded.

## Inventory Format

Each source has a `cases.jsonl` file with one compact JSON object per line.
Records are sorted by `path`, then `id`, and use these fields:

- `id`: stable upstream case identifier, unique within the source.
- `path`: path relative to the pinned upstream revision.
- `category`: lower-kebab-case behavior group.
- `status`: one of the statuses above.
- `target`: raftz source or test file providing coverage.
- `rationale`: concise reason for the classification.

`target` is required for `adapted`, `reimplemented`, and
`covered_elsewhere`; it is omitted for all other statuses. Source manifests
pin the expected record and status counts so accidental inventory changes fail
the audit tests. A `covered_elsewhere` target must directly assert the recorded
behavior; executing related code or testing a broader component is not enough.
